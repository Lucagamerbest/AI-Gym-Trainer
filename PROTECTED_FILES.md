# Protected Files - DO NOT MODIFY

## Files that are working correctly and should NOT be modified:

### ⚠️ CRITICAL - Exercise Library System ⚠️

**Files:**
- `src/screens/ExerciseListScreen.js`
- `src/data/exerciseDatabase.js`

**Status:** WORKING PERFECTLY
- ✅ Displays exercises on localhost
- ✅ Displays exercises on Expo Go (iPhone)
- ✅ All debugging and connection issues resolved

**Last Working Date:** September 13, 2025

**Protection Level:** HIGH - Only modify with explicit user permission and absolute necessity

## Modification Rules:

1. **NEVER** modify these files for minor improvements or refactoring
2. **ONLY** modify if:
   - User explicitly requests changes to Exercise Library functionality
   - Critical bug that breaks the app entirely
   - Security vulnerability

3. **ALWAYS** create backup before any modification
4. **ALWAYS** test on both localhost AND Expo Go before considering changes complete

## Recovery Instructions:

If these files get broken, revert to git commit `3360901`:
```bash
git checkout 3360901 -- src/screens/ExerciseListScreen.js
git checkout 3360901 -- src/data/exerciseDatabase.js
```

## Working Configuration:
- Exercise Library shows bright red cards with yellow text (debugging styling)
- Debug logs visible in Metro console
- FlatList rendering with proper styling
- Navigation works correctly between screens
