## 🔧 How It Works

All these screens now have the 🤖 button because:

1. **They use ScreenLayout** with `screenName` prop
2. **ScreenLayout automatically adds AIHeaderButton** when screenName is provided
3. **AIHeaderButton opens AIButtonModal** (button-based interface)
4. **AIButtonModal loads sections** from `aiSectionConfig.js`

No code changes needed in the screens - just configuration!

---

## 🚀 Testing

To test any screen:

1. **Navigate to the screen** (e.g., Exercise Library)
2. **Look for 🤖 button** at top left
3. **Tap the button** → Modal opens
4. **See organized sections** specific to that screen
5. **Tap any button** → AI processes with context
6. **Get response** in modal

## 📋 Files Modified

**Only 1 file changed:**
- `src/config/aiSectionConfig.js` - Added 7 new screen configurations

**No screen files modified!**
