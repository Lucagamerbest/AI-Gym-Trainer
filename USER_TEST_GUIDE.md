# üß™ USER TEST GUIDE - 2024 Research Implementation

## Quick Reference: 5 Tests You Can Do Right Now

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 1: Exercise Selection (Incline > Flat Bench)

### **What to Test:**
Check if your AI prioritizes incline press over flat bench (2024 research update)

### **How to Test:**
1. Open your app
2. Ask your AI: **"Create a push workout"** or **"Generate a chest workout"**

### **Expected Result:**
The workout should start with **Incline Press** as exercise #1, NOT flat bench:

```
‚úÖ CORRECT (2024 Update):
1. Incline Barbell Press - 4√ó6-10
2. Overhead Press - 3√ó6-10
3. Flat Bench Press - 3√ó8-12  ‚Üê Flat bench is 2nd or 3rd now
4. Lateral Raise - 3√ó12-15
5. Overhead Tricep Extension - 3√ó10-15  ‚Üê Not pushdowns!

‚ùå OLD WAY:
1. Flat Bench Press - 4√ó6-10  ‚Üê This would be wrong now
```

### **Why This Matters:**
2024 research shows 45¬∞ incline press provides superior upper chest development + equal mid/lower chest activation compared to flat bench.

**Status if Passed:** ‚úÖ Exercise hierarchy is working!

## ‚úÖ TEST 2: Volume Analysis (Am I Training Enough?)

### **What to Test:**
Check if your AI can analyze weekly training volume and give recommendations based on 2024 meta-analysis

### **How to Test:**
1. Open your app
2. Ask your AI: **"Am I doing enough chest volume?"** or **"How many sets for chest?"**

### **Expected Result:**
Your AI should:
1. Call the `analyzeWeeklyVolume` tool
2. Tell you your current weekly sets
3. Compare it to optimal range (8-18 sets/week)
4. Give a recommendation

```
Example Response:
"You're doing 12 sets/week for chest. This is optimal!
The 2024 meta-analysis recommends 8-18 sets/week for hypertrophy.
You're in the sweet spot. üí™"

OR if too low:
"You're doing 6 sets/week for chest. This is below optimal (8-18 recommended).
Add 1 more chest exercise OR train chest 2x/week instead of 1x/week."
```

### **Why This Matters:**
2024 meta-analysis found minimum 4 sets/week to stimulate growth, with 8-18 sets/week being optimal for most people.

**Status if Passed:** ‚úÖ Volume tracking is working!

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 3: Progressive Overload (What Weight Should I Use?)

### **What to Test:**
Check if your AI gives SPECIFIC weight recommendations based on your last workout

### **How to Test:**
1. Complete a workout (or use existing history)
2. Ask your AI: **"What weight should I use for bench press?"** or **"Recommend next weight for squats"**

### **Expected Result:**
Your AI should:
1. Call the `getProgressiveOverloadAdvice` tool
2. Check your last session (weight, reps, RPE)
3. Give you EXACT next weight and reps

```
Example Response:
"Last session you did 185 lbs √ó 8 reps @ RPE 7.

Use 190 lbs √ó 8 reps next session (+5 lbs).

Reason: Your RPE was 7 (3 reps left in the tank), so it's time to
add weight. This follows Jeff Nippard's 2024 progression method."
```

### **Why This Matters:**
Jeff Nippard's RPE-based progression method (2024) gives you exact weight recommendations instead of generic advice like "add 5-10 lbs."

**Status if Passed:** ‚úÖ Progressive overload tracker is working!

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 4: Deload Detection (Do I Need a Rest Week?)

### **What to Test:**
Check if your AI can detect when you need a deload week based on training duration

### **How to Test:**
1. Ask your AI: **"Do I need a deload week?"** or **"Should I take a rest week?"**

### **Expected Result:**
Your AI should:
1. Call the `checkDeloadStatus` tool
2. Check how many weeks you've trained continuously
3. Recommend deload if you've trained 4+ weeks

```
Example Responses:

If trained < 4 weeks:
"You've trained 2 weeks. No deload needed yet. Continue training.
I'll recommend a deload at week 4 (Jeff Nippard protocol)."

If trained 4-6 weeks:
"üîµ DELOAD WEEK RECOMMENDED: You've trained 5 weeks straight.
Time for deload: Reduce sets by 50%, keep weight/RPE same.
Example: 4√ó8 @ 200 lbs ‚Üí 2√ó8 @ 200 lbs for 1 week."

If trained 6+ weeks:
"üö® DELOAD OVERDUE: You've trained 7 weeks without a deload!
Your body needs recovery. Take a deload week immediately."
```

### **Why This Matters:**
Jeff Nippard's 2024 protocol recommends deloading every 4-6 weeks to prevent overtraining and allow supercompensation.

**Status if Passed:** ‚úÖ Deload detection is working!

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 5: Pull Workout (Pull-ups > Lat Pulldowns)

### **What to Test:**
Check if your AI prioritizes pull-ups over lat pulldowns (Jeff Nippard 2024 upgrade)

### **How to Test:**
1. Ask your AI: **"Create a pull workout"** or **"Generate a back workout"**

### **Expected Result:**
The workout should start with **Pull-ups** as the first vertical pull exercise:

```
‚úÖ CORRECT (2024 Update):
1. Pull-up - 3√ó6-10  ‚Üê Pull-ups come FIRST now (upgraded to S-tier)
2. Barbell Row - 4√ó8-12
3. Cable Row - 3√ó10-15
4. Face Pull - 3√ó15-20
5. Bayesian Curl - 3√ó8-12  ‚Üê Not preacher curls!

‚ùå OLD WAY:
1. Lat Pulldown - 3√ó8-12  ‚Üê This would be wrong now
2. Barbell Row - 4√ó8-12
```

### **Why This Matters:**
Jeff Nippard's 2024 experiment upgraded pull-ups to S-tier because they provide more full-body tension and are harder to cheat on than lat pulldowns.

**Status if Passed:** ‚úÖ Back exercise prioritization is working!

## üéØ BONUS TESTS (Optional)

### **Test 6: Overhead Extensions > Pushdowns**
Ask: **"Create a tricep workout"**

Why: 2024 study shows +50% long head growth, +40% overall vs pushdowns

### **Test 7: Bayesian Curls > Preacher Curls**
Ask: **"Create a bicep workout"** (if you have cables)
Expected: Bayesian curls should be included
Why: 2024 comparison study shows superior hypertrophy vs preacher curls

### **Test 8: Progress Tracking**
Ask: **"Am I progressing on bench press?"** (if you have workout history)
Expected: AI shows volume change % and trend analysis
Why: New progression tracking system analyzes gains over time

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Test 1 Fails (Flat Bench Still First):**
- Check: `WorkoutTools.js` should use `sortByResearch2024()`
- Check: `ExerciseHierarchy2024.js` exists with incline press priority 1
- Solution: Restart your app to reload the updated workout generation

### **If Test 2-4 Fail (AI Doesn't Use Tools):**
- Check: `tools/index.js` should have all 4 new tools registered
- Check: AI system prompt includes volume/progression tool instructions
- Solution: Verify tools are initialized when app starts

### **If Test 5 Fails (Lat Pulldowns Still First):**
- Check: `ExerciseHierarchy2024.js` has pull-ups as S-tier priority 1
- Check: Lat pulldowns are marked as Tier B
- Solution: Verify exercise database has "Pull-up" or "Pull Up" entries
