# Phase 13: Proactive AI Suggestions - IN PROGRESS ⚡

**Started:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** Core features complete, testing in progress

---

## 🎯 What We Built

### **Proactive AI System**

AI that automatically detects key moments and offers contextual help:

**Key Moments Detected:**
1. **Workout Just Completed** (within 2 minutes)
2. **PR Achievement** (new personal record)
3. **Nutrition Alerts** (low calories/protein in evening)
4. **Consistency Reminders** (3+ days since last workout)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **1. ProactiveAIService** (`src/services/ai/ProactiveAIService.js`)

Centralized service for detecting moments and generating suggestions.

**Core Methods:**

#### `checkWorkoutCompletion(userId)`
```javascript
// Detects workout completed within last 2 minutes
// Returns: { type: 'workout_complete', title, message, action, data, priority }
```

#### `checkPRDetection(userId)`
```javascript
// Detects new PRs achieved within last 5 minutes
// Compares latest workout exercise maxes to historical data
// Returns: { type: 'pr_achieved', title, message, action, data, priority }
```

#### `checkNutritionAlerts(userId)`
```javascript
// Checks if under 70% of daily nutrition goals after 6pm
// Returns: { type: 'nutrition_alert', title, message, action, data, priority }
```

#### `checkWorkoutConsistency(userId)`
```javascript
// Reminds if 3+ days since last workout
// Returns: { type: 'consistency_reminder', title, message, action, data, priority }
```

#### `getAllSuggestions(userId)`
```javascript
// Runs all checks in parallel
// Returns sorted array by priority (high > medium > low)
```

#### `getSuggestionPrompt(suggestion)`
```javascript
// Converts suggestion into AI-ready prompt
// Example: "I just hit a new PR on Bench Press: 85 lbs × 6 reps. What should my next goal be?"
```

### **5. Enhanced AIChatModal** (`src/components/AIChatModal.js`)

Now accepts `initialMessage` prop for proactive prompts.

**New Props:**
- `initialMessage` - String to auto-send when chat opens

**Behavior:**
```javascript
<AIChatModal
  visible={chatVisible}
  onClose={() => setChatVisible(false)}
  initialMessage="I just hit a new PR on Bench Press: 85 lbs × 6 reps. What should my next goal be?"
/>
```

When `initialMessage` is provided:
1. Chat opens
2. Message appears in input field
3. After 500ms, message is auto-sent
4. AI responds immediately
5. Flag prevents re-sending on re-render

---

### **6. App.js Integration**

AI tab icon now shows badge when suggestions available.

**Changes:**
```javascript
// TabNavigator checks for suggestions every 30 seconds
const [aiSuggestionCount, setAISuggestionCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  const checkSuggestions = async () => {
    const suggestions = await ProactiveAIService.getAllSuggestions(user.uid);
    setAISuggestionCount(suggestions.length);
  };

  checkSuggestions();
  const interval = setInterval(checkSuggestions, 30000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [user?.uid]);

// AI tab icon with badge
<Tab.Screen
  name="AI"
  component={AIScreen}
  options={{
    tabBarIcon: () => (
      <View>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 24 }}>🤖</Text>
        <AIBadge count={aiSuggestionCount} visible={aiSuggestionCount > 0} />
      </View>
    ),
  }}
/>
```

## 🎬 User Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Workout Completion**

**Scenario:** User finishes a workout

1. **1 minute later** → ProactiveAIService detects workout completed
2. **AI tab badge appears** → Red "1" pulsing on 🤖 icon
3. **User taps AI tab** → Sees suggestion card:
   ```
   🎉 Workout Complete!
   Great job finishing your workout!
   Want me to analyze your performance?
   [HIGH]          Tap to ask AI →
   ```
4. **User taps card** → Chat opens with auto-sent message:
   ```
   User: "I just completed a workout: Push Day - Upper Body.
          Can you analyze my performance and give me feedback?"

   AI: "Great work on your Push Day! You completed 5 exercises
        with 2,400 lbs total volume. Your Bench Press is progressing
        nicely—you hit 85 lbs × 6 reps, which is 5 lbs more than last time.
        Consider adding 5 more lbs next session if it felt manageable!"
   ```

---

### **Example 2: PR Achievement**

**Scenario:** User hits new bench press PR

1. **During workout** → User logs 90 lbs × 5 reps (previous max: 85 lbs)
2. **Within 5 minutes** → ProactiveAIService detects PR
3. **AI tab badge appears** → Red "1" pulsing
4. **User taps AI tab** → Sees:
   ```
   🏆 New PR!
   You just hit a new PR on Bench Press: 90 lbs!
   Should I suggest your next goal?
   [HIGH]          Tap to ask AI →
   ```
5. **User taps** → Chat opens:
   ```
   User: "I just hit a new PR on Bench Press: 90 lbs × 5 reps
          (previous: 85 lbs). What should my next goal be?"

   AI: "🎉 Congrats on the PR! You increased 5 lbs in 2 weeks—solid
        progress! Your next goal should be 95 lbs × 5 reps. Based on
        your progression rate, you should hit this in 2-3 workouts.
        Keep your form strict and rest 2-3 minutes between sets!"
   ```

---

### **Example 3: Nutrition Alert**

**Scenario:** It's 7pm, user is under calorie/protein goals

1. **7:00 PM** → ProactiveAIService checks nutrition
2. **User at 1,200/2,000 cal** → Alert triggered
3. **AI tab badge** → Orange "1" (medium priority)
4. **User taps AI tab** → Sees:
   ```
   🍽️ Nutrition Check
   You have 800 cal and 60g protein left today.
   Need meal ideas?
   [MEDIUM]        Tap to ask AI →
   ```
5. **User taps** → Chat opens:
   ```
   User: "I have 800 calories and 60g protein left today.
          What should I eat?"

   AI: "Perfect timing! Here's a great option:
        • 8oz grilled chicken breast (330 cal, 60g protein)
        • 1.5 cups rice (300 cal, 6g carbs)
        • Veggies + olive oil (150 cal)

        Total: 780 cal, 66g protein—hits your goals perfectly!"
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Suggestion Priority System**

```javascript
priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'

// Sorting
const priorityOrder = { high: 0, medium: 1, low: 2 };
suggestions.sort((a, b) => priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority]);

// Visual
high:   🔴 Red border   (immediate attention)
medium: 🟠 Amber border (helpful reminder)
low:    🟢 Green border (nice to know)
```

---

### **Dismissal System**

Prevents showing same suggestion repeatedly:

```javascript
class ProactiveAIService {
  dismissedSuggestions = new Set();

  dismissSuggestion(suggestionType, suggestionId) {
    this.dismissedSuggestions.add(`${suggestionType}_${suggestionId}`);
  }

  // Example: dismissSuggestion('pr_achieved', 'Bench Press_90')
  // Won't show again for this PR
}
```

**Dismissed suggestions persist** until:
- App restarts
- User calls `clearDismissed()`
- Daily reset (future enhancement)

---

### **Time Windows**

```javascript
Workout Completion: 0-2 minutes after workout end
PR Detection:       0-5 minutes after workout end
Nutrition Alert:    After 6:00 PM, if < 70% of daily goals
Consistency:        If 3+ days since last workout
```

Why these windows?
- **Workout completion** → Immediate, while workout is fresh in mind
- **PR detection** → Slightly longer to account for workout finalization
- **Nutrition** → Evening check gives time to adjust dinner
- **Consistency** → Non-urgent, gentle nudge

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### **Polling Strategy**

**Badge updates:**
- Check every **30 seconds** when app is open
- Only runs if user is signed in
- Cleans up interval on unmount

**Screen updates:**
- Check when **AI screen is focused** (useFocusEffect)
- Manual refresh with **pull-to-refresh**
- No background checks (battery-friendly)

### **Data Fetching**

```javascript
// Parallel checks (fast)
await Promise.all([
  checkWorkoutCompletion(userId),
  checkPRDetection(userId),
  checkNutritionAlerts(userId),
  checkWorkoutConsistency(userId),
]);

// Total time: ~100-200ms
```

### **Memory Management**

- Dismissed suggestions stored in memory (Set)
- Not persisted to AsyncStorage (lightweight)
- Clears on app restart (fresh slate daily)

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Badge Animation**

```javascript
// Pulse effect
Animated.loop(
  Animated.sequence([
    Animated.timing(pulseAnim, { toValue: 1.2, duration: 1000 }),
    Animated.timing(pulseAnim, { toValue: 1, duration: 1000 }),
  ])
).start();

// Result: Smooth breathing effect that catches attention
```

### **Card Animation**

```javascript
// Slide in from below + fade in
Animated.parallel([
  Animated.spring(slideAnim, { toValue: 0, tension: 50, friction: 7 }),
  Animated.timing(opacityAnim, { toValue: 1, duration: 300 }),
]).start();

// Result: Cards gracefully appear from bottom
```

5. **Expected:** Red badge "1" on AI tab
6. **Tap AI tab** → See "New PR!" card
7. **Tap card** → Chat opens with PR celebration + goal suggestion

**Note:** PR detection compares to historical `exercise_progress` data.

---

### **Test 3: Nutrition Alert**

1. **Change device time to 6:30 PM** (or wait until evening)
2. **Log some food** but stay under 70% of daily goal
   - Example: If goal is 2,000 cal, log only 1,200 cal
3. **Navigate away from AI tab**
4. **Wait 30 seconds**
5. **Expected:** Orange badge "1" on AI tab
6. **Tap AI tab** → See "Nutrition Check" card
7. **Tap card** → Chat opens with meal suggestions

---

### **Test 4: Consistency Reminder**

**Note:** This requires 3+ days without working out.

**Quick Test (Mock Data):**
1. **Modify ProactiveAIService.js** temporarily:
   ```javascript
   // Change line in checkWorkoutConsistency:
   if (daysAgo >= 0.01) { // Was: >= 3
   ```
2. **Restart app**
3. **Wait 30 seconds**
4. **Expected:** Green badge "1" on AI tab
5. **Tap AI tab** → See "Ready to Train?" card

**Revert change after testing.**

---

### **Test 5: Dismissal**

1. **Trigger any suggestion**
2. **Tap X button** on suggestion card
3. **Card disappears**
4. **Pull to refresh**
5. **Expected:** Card does not reappear
6. **Restart app** → Card may reappear (dismissed set clears)

---

### **Test 6: Multiple Suggestions**

1. **Trigger multiple conditions:**
   - Complete workout
   - Hit a PR in same workout
   - Have low nutrition (evening + under 70%)
2. **Expected:** Badge shows "3"
3. **Tap AI tab** → See 3 cards sorted by priority:
   1. 🔴 Workout Complete (high)
   2. 🔴 New PR (high)
   3. 🟠 Nutrition Check (medium)
