# Phase 10: Context-Aware AI Architecture - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Completed:** October 15, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes

---

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

‚úÖ Created ContextManager to track user's current screen
‚úÖ Built context extraction system
‚úÖ Implemented screen tracking hooks
‚úÖ Added tracking to key screens (Workout, Nutrition, Progress)
‚úÖ AI now knows what the user is doing

---

## üì¶ What We Built

### 1. **ContextManager (`src/services/ai/ContextManager.js`)**

The brain of our context-aware AI system. Tracks:
- Current screen the user is on
- User profile data (goals, preferences)
- Recent activity (workouts, meals last 7 days)
- Screen-specific context (current workout, today's meals, progress entries)

**Key Methods:**
```javascript
// Set current screen
ContextManager.setScreen('WorkoutDetailScreen', { workoutName: 'Push Day' });

// Get full context for AI
const context = await ContextManager.getFullContext();

// Get workout-specific context
const workoutContext = await ContextManager.getWorkoutContext();
```

### 2. **AIScreenTracker (`src/components/AIScreenTracker.js`)**

Simple React hook that screens use to register themselves:

```javascript
// In any screen component:
import { useAITracking } from '../components/AIScreenTracker';

function MyScreen() {
  useAITracking('MyScreenName', {
    relevantData: 'value',
    moreData: 123,
  });

  // Rest of component...
}
```

### 3. **Screen Integration**

Added tracking to three key screens:

**WorkoutDetailScreen:**
- Tracks workout name, exercise count, total sets
- AI knows what workout you're viewing

**NutritionDashboard:**
- Tracks calories consumed, calorie goal, meals today
- AI knows your nutrition status

**ProgressScreen:**
- Tracks total workouts, volume, active goals
- AI knows your progress metrics

## üß† How Context Works

### When you open a screen:

1. **Screen mounts** ‚Üí `useAITracking` hook activates
2. **ContextManager** records screen name + relevant data
3. **AI can now access** this context when you ask questions

### Example Context Data:

```javascript
{
  screen: "WorkoutDetailScreen",
  screenData: {
    workoutName: "Push Day",
    exerciseCount: 5,
    totalSets: 15
  },
  userData: {
    goals: { targetCalories: 2500, proteinGrams: 180 }
  },
  recentActivity: {
    workouts: 3,
    totalVolume: 45000,
    avgCaloriesPerDay: 2300
  },
  screenSpecific: {
    exerciseCount: 5,
    totalVolume: 12500,
    muscleGroups: ["chest", "triceps"]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Testing Context Tracking

### How to test:

1. **Open your browser** ‚Üí http://localhost:8081
2. **Open the console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
3. **Navigate to different screens:**
   - Go to Workouts ‚Üí Click any workout
   - Go to Nutrition Dashboard
   - Go to Progress Screen

4. **Watch the console logs:**
   - You'll see: `üìç Context: Now on WorkoutDetailScreen`
   - You'll see: `üìç ContextManager initialized`

### Test the AI with context:

1. **Go to Debug screen** (Profile ‚Üí Debug)
2. **In the browser console, type:**
```javascript
// Get current context
import ContextManager from './src/services/ai/ContextManager';
await ContextManager.getFullContext();
```

3. **You should see** all the context data the AI has access to!
