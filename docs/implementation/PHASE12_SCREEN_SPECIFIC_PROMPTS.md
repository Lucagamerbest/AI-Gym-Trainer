### **2. Enhanced AI Service** (`src/services/ai/AIService.js`)

Added intelligent screen-specific coaching personalities:

#### **Workout Coach Mode**
When on workout screens, the AI focuses on:
- Progressive overload (specific weight recommendations)
- Optimal set/rep ranges based on history
- Volume management (preventing overtraining)
- Form and recovery emphasis
- Specific weight increases (5-10 lbs typically)

**Example Response:**
> "Looking at your bench press history, you've hit 80 lbs for 6 reps consistently. Try adding 5 lbs next workout—aim for 85×5-6 reps. Your volume today is solid at 700 lbs total, so you have room to push!"

#### **Nutrition Coach Mode**
When on nutrition screens, the AI focuses on:
- Precise macro calculations
- Specific meal/food suggestions
- Warnings about over/under eating
- Meal timing recommendations
- Protein intake emphasis

**Example Response:**
> "You have 500 calories and 40g protein left today. A 6oz grilled chicken breast with sweet potato would give you 280 cal, 50g protein—perfect for post-workout!"

#### **Progress Analyst Mode**
When on progress screens, the AI focuses on:
- Specific strength gains with numbers
- Plateau identification
- PR celebrations
- Program adjustment recommendations
- Consistency tracking

**Example Response:**
> "Your bench press has increased from 75 lbs to 80 lbs over 2 workouts—that's a 6.6% strength gain! Keep this pace and you'll hit 85 lbs in your next session. Great progress!"

#### **General Coach Mode**
When on profile/home screens, the AI provides:
- Overall fitness journey overview
- Next steps based on recent activity
- Balanced workout/nutrition/recovery advice
- Realistic short-term goal setting

## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Flow:**

1. **Open AI Chat** → See quick suggestions based on current screen
2. **Tap a suggestion** → Input auto-fills with the question
3. **Press send** → AI responds with screen-specific coaching
4. **Get specific advice** → Numbers, recommendations, actionable steps

### **Example Interaction:**

**On Workout Screen:**
```
User taps: "Should I increase weight?"
Input fills: "Should I increase weight?"
User sends →

AI Response: "Your last Dumbbell Bench Press was 80 lbs × 6 reps.
Since you completed all sets, add 5 lbs next time—aim for 85 lbs × 5-6 reps.
Your form is priority, so if 85 feels too heavy, stay at 80 and aim for 8 reps!"
```

**On Nutrition Screen:**
```
User taps: "How many calories left today?"
Input fills: "How many calories left today?"
User sends →

AI Response: "You've eaten 1,500 of 2,000 calories today—500 left!
Your protein is at 100g/150g, so focus on high-protein foods.
A protein shake (200 cal, 40g protein) would be perfect before bed."
```

## 💡 What Makes It Smart

### **Before Phase 12:**
```
User: "Should I add weight?"
AI: "Listen to your body. If it feels easy, add 5-10 lbs."
```
❌ Generic, no specific data

### **After Phase 12:**
```
User: *Taps "Should I increase weight?"*
AI: "Your Dumbbell Bench Press PR is 80 lbs × 6 reps (10/14/25).
You hit all sets last workout, so add 5 lbs—try 85 lbs × 5-6 reps.
Your volume is 700 lbs today, well within safe range!"
```
✅ Specific, data-driven, actionable

## 📊 Screen Personality Examples

### **Workout Coach (On WorkoutDetailScreen)**

**Principles:**
- Focus on progressive overload
- Recommend specific weight increases
- Suggest optimal set/rep ranges
- Warn about volume management
- Emphasize proper form and recovery

**Example Question:** "How many sets should I do?"

**AI Response:**
> "Based on your history, 3-4 sets of bench press works well for you. You've been doing 3 sets at 80 lbs—if you want more volume, add a 4th set at 75 lbs (easier weight). Total volume: ~1,200 lbs is ideal for chest day."

---

### **Nutrition Coach (On NutritionDashboard)**

**Principles:**
- Calculate remaining macros precisely
- Suggest specific meals/foods
- Warn if too far from goals
- Recommend meal timing
- Focus on protein intake

**Example Question:** "What should I eat for dinner?"

**AI Response:**
> "You need 500 cal, 40g protein, and 50g carbs. Try: 6oz grilled salmon (280 cal, 40g protein) + 1 cup rice (200 cal, 45g carbs) + veggies (50 cal). That hits all your targets perfectly!"

---

### **Progress Analyst (On ProgressScreen)**

**Principles:**
- Identify specific strength gains
- Point out plateaus and solutions
- Celebrate PRs and improvements
- Recommend program adjustments
- Track consistency

**Example Question:** "Am I making progress?"

**AI Response:**
