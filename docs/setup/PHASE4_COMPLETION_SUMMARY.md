## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User initiates sign-in (Google or Email)
   ↓
2. Authentication credentials sent to Firebase Auth
   ↓
3. Firebase Auth validates and creates/signs in user
   ↓
4. onAuthStateChanged listener triggered
   ↓
5. BackendService.createOrUpdateUserProfile() called
   ↓
6. User profile created/updated in Firestore
   ↓
7. User object synchronized in AuthContext
   ↓
8. UI updates to reflect authenticated state
```

### Firestore User Profile Structure

```javascript
users/{userId}
├── uid: string
├── email: string
├── displayName: string
├── photoURL: string
├── createdAt: timestamp
├── updatedAt: timestamp
├── settings: {
│   ├── units: 'imperial' | 'metric'
│   └── theme: 'light' | 'dark'
└── goals: {
    ├── targetCalories: number
    ├── proteinGrams: number
    ├── carbsGrams: number
    └── fatGrams: number
}
```
