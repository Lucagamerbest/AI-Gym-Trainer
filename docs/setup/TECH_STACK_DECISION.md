# Technology Stack Decision

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Phase**: 1 - Decision & Setup

## Backend Choice: Firebase ✅

### Why Firebase?
1. **Fast Setup**: 2-3 hours vs 6+ hours for alternatives
2. **Built-in Authentication**: Already using Google Sign-In, Firebase integrates perfectly
3. **Real-time Sync**: Firestore provides automatic real-time synchronization
4. **Free Tier**: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day - sufficient for MVP and early users
5. **Scalability**: Can handle thousands of users without infrastructure management
6. **Mobile-First**: Designed specifically for mobile apps like ours

### Alternatives Considered
- **Supabase**: Better for complex SQL queries, but overkill for our needs
- **Custom Node.js + PostgreSQL**: Full control but requires DevOps expertise and more time

## AI Provider: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash ✅

### Why Gemini?
1. **FREE Tier**: 1,500 requests/day = ~45,000/month (covers 1,100 users!)
2. **No Credit Card**: Start developing immediately without payment
3. **Fast**: Optimized for speed (great UX)
4. **Quality**: Very good for fitness coaching (4/5 stars)
5. **Easy to Switch**: Can upgrade to Claude/GPT-4 later if needed

### Cost Estimate
- **FREE Tier**: 1,500 requests/day
- **Paid Tier** (if you exceed free):
  - Input: $0.075 per 1M tokens
  - Output: $0.30 per 1M tokens
- **Expected monthly cost for 1000 active users**: $0 (FREE!)
- **Expected monthly cost for 5000 active users**: ~$30/month (paid tier)

### Alternatives Considered
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best quality but $250/month for 1000 users
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Good quality but $11-30/month for 1000 users
- **Strategy**: Start free with Gemini, upgrade to Claude later if needed
