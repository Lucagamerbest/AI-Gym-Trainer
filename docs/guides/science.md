Are you guilty of walking into the gym, taking a look around, and jumping on whatever piece of equipment is free - no plan in mind? We've all been there. But, if this is something you do on the regular, you might want to consider implementing a workout split into your training regime. This is a way of planning out your strength training workouts to make them more effective, enjoyable and time-efficient.

Just having a workout split, however, is not enough. You need to select the right one. In fact, we’d go as far as saying that having the right workout split can make or break your gym routine… get the right one, and you could be seeing your gains accelerate; get the wrong one, and you may just end up feeling unmotivated, overtraining, and nowhere near your fitness goals.

So, how do you choose the right workout split? We’ve put together a guide of the very best workout splits for different levels and goals – so whether a workout split is an entirely new concept to you, or you’re looking for a new training split to accelerate your progress, we have the answer.

Get ready to enter the world of PPLs, back and bis, and the full body sesh. You’ll be an expert on workout splits before you know it.

From squat-proof leggings to carry you through new 1 rep maxes to seamless t-shirts that accentuate your shoulder and biceps on arm day–whatever body part you're training and no matter what lift is on the cards, our lifting range will carry you through every single rep.

What Is A Workout Split?
A workout split is a way of organizing your strength training into an effective, time-efficient program. Not only does it ensure no muscle goes untouched, but it also gives you structure to track your progress week-on-week to implement progressive overload (i.e. increasing the load each week). Oh, and you know that feeling when you’re attempting to do a lift but your muscles feel so tired and sore that you struggle? With programmed rest days and structure that sees different muscle groups trained on different days, a workout split allows adequate time for recovery to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of injury.

Splits can come in 2, 3, 4, and 5 day workout splits (or even more in some cases!), and there’s a variety of ways to implement a workout split (this is where things get a little complicated, but we’ll break it down for you).

The most common workout splits are:

Full Body Workout Split: (best workout split for beginners)
Push, Pull, Legs Workout Split: (best workout split for intermediate lifters)
Upper, Lower Workout Split: (best workout split for strength gains)
Body Part Workout Split: (best workout split for muscle gain ie. hypertrophy).
You might already be following one of these splits (whether you realize it or not), but ensuring you are on the right workout split for your level and goals is essential. Here's our guide to the best workout splits, and how you can choose the right one for you.

Best Workout Split For Beginners: Full Body Workout Split
Number of Days: 2 or 3-day workout split
Whether you’re a beginner looking to start building a well-rounded physique, or you’re someone who’s time pressured and wants a workout that gives them the best bang for their buck - a full body workout split will give your muscles all the attention they need.

By not prioritizing certain muscle groups over another, the full body workout split will allow you to hit all the major muscle groups in less time, making it suited to those who are time-poor and looking for a 2 or 3-day workout split.

A 3-day Full Body Workout Split May Look Like This:
Monday: Full Body
Tuesday: Rest
Wednesday: Full Body
Thursday: Rest
Friday: Full Body
Saturday: Rest
Sunday: Rest
Benefits Of Full Body Workout Split:
Ideally suited to compound training: Full body split prioritizes exercises that engage multiple muscle groups at once (compound exercises) to promote muscle growth and improve coordination, flexibility, and mobility.
Time efficient: Working with each muscle group in every session means you only need to train 2 to 3 days a week to see progress. Studies back this up, finding that as long as the weekly volume of work is the same, two full-body workout splits a week, elicit the same strength gains and muscle hypertrophy as a 4-day split-muscle routine [1].
Flexibility: Plenty of time to program in rest days or days focusing on other training e.g. cardio. If you miss a day it won’t disproportionately affect certain muscle groups, allowing for consistent progress.
Increased calorific burn: Compound exercises require more energy expenditure than isolation exercises, so this method of training is good for increased calorie burn, enhancing fat loss, and cardio.
Drawbacks of Full Body Workout Split:
Some muscles may be neglected: Your training may prioritize certain muscle groups over others which may lead to muscular imbalances.
Hard to increase training frequency without overtraining: The American Council of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Guidelines suggest allowing at least 48 hours between resistance training exercise sessions for a major muscle group. When training full body, this would mean you need a full 48 hours between training sessions, making it hard to increase the frequency without the risk of overtraining.
Best Workout Split For Intermediate Lifters: Push Pull Legs Workout Split
Number of days: 3 day workout split, or 6 day workout split (with 3 days on, 1 day off in a cyclical format)
If you’re looking to hit every single muscle group then a PPL workout split (push pull legs) is a simple format to follow: One day you focus on upper body pushing exercises, the next you focus on upper body pulling exercises, then finally, you train legs. Put that together, and it will look something like this:

Monday: Push (chest, shoulders, triceps) e.g. bench press, overhead press, or landmine press
Wednesday: Pull (back and biceps) e.g. deadlifts, pull ups, lat pull down
Friday: Legs (quads, hamstring, glutes, calves) e.g. back squats, RDLs, hip thrusts
Traditionally, this training split groups together related muscle groups into one session, using compound movements to hit all the target muscle groups. This maximizes training volume of target muscles during the session, whilst giving adequate time for recovery between training days, making it one of the most efficient training splits [2].

Advanced lifters may further increase the intensity by cycling the push pull legs split workout plan 3 days on, 1 day off to increase the training volume and maximise gains [3].

Benefits Of Push Pull Legs Workout Split:
Prioritizes compound exercises: These hit most or all of the target muscle groups for that training day to maximize training stimulus.
Adequate recovery time: The same muscle group is never worked on consecutive days, giving time for the muscles to recover before training again.
Tailor to your goals: The 3 day workout split provides the option to focus on cardio and conditioning on the alternate days, or you may choose to add in an extra leg day or accessory work day to hone in on specific muscle groups you want to target.
Drawbacks of Push Pull Legs Workout Split:
3 day workout split may not be enough training stimulus to elicit muscle growth: The three day split only focuses on major muscle groups once a week. Ideally, you want to be training each major group at least twice a week to maximize gains [4].
Little room for flexibility: Using a 3 day on, 1 day off rolling schedule is unpredictable, as your rest days will change each week.
May not be suited to those who are time-poor: PPL workouts can take more than 60 minutes because they are focusing on multiple muscle groups in each session.
Best Workout Split For Strength Gains: Upper Lower Split Workout
Number of days: 2, 3, 4, 5 or even 6-day workout split.
Walk into a gym and this will, hands down, be the workout split the majority of lifters are following: It’s easy to program, it can be done as many (or as few) days as you want, and most importantly, it’s effective.

The upper-lower workout split follows one day where you train the upper body muscles (i.e. chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps) and the next lower body muscles (i.e. glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves). This gives plenty of time in each session to focus on heavy compound exercises combined with lighter accessory work.

The best way to program this split is over 4 days, as studies have proven strength training performed over a 4-day workout split to be just as effective in building fat-free muscle mass and strength as a 6-day workout split, whilst allowing adequate time for recovery [5].

A 4-day Workout Split Would Look Something Like This:
Monday: Upper body
Tuesday: Lower body
Wednesday: Rest / Cardio / Accessory work
Thursday: Upper body
Friday: Lower body
Saturday: Rest / Cardio / Accessory work
Sunday: Rest / Cardio / Accessory work
Benefits of Upper Lower Split Workout:
Adequate recovery time: The same muscle groups are not trained on consecutive days, giving muscles at least 48 hours between sessions to recover.
Flexible: Easy to scale up or down depending on the number of days you want to train.
Time for focusing on additional goals: If taking the 4-day workout split, you have days spare to focus on other goals e.g. cardio/conditioning or accessory work.
Effective for building muscle strength and size: Work to a 4-day workout split or more to hit each major muscle group twice a week, providing adequate stimulus for muscle growth and strength gains.
Drawbacks of Upper Lower Split Workout:
Some muscles may get neglected: Without careful programming, you may neglect some muscle groups whilst overtraining others. This could lead to muscular imbalances over time.
Best Workout Split For Muscle Gain (Hypertrophy): Body Part Workout Split
Number of days: 5 day workout split
Back in the day, bodybuilders would train to something called the ‘Bro Split Workout’, which would see them train a different muscle group each day. The thinking behind this was that you could accelerate hypertrophy in a single muscle group by focusing a whole session on it and giving it a whole week to recover before training it again.

Fast forward to 2024, and we’ve got a bit more knowledge under our belts and know that ideally, we want to be hitting each muscle group more frequently than that (ideally twice a week). The body part workout split takes the foundations of the bro workout split, breaking up training into specific body parts, usually focusing on two body parts per day. Whilst it does include some compound lifts, this style of training prioritizes isolation exercises and accessory work, to hone in on developing the singular muscle group(s) being worked, making it ideally suited to bodybuilders.

The Body Part Workout Split May Look Something Like This:
Monday: Chest & Biceps
Tuesday: Quads & Glutes
Wednesday: Rest
Thursday: Back & Triceps
Friday: Glutes & Hamstrings
Saturday: Shoulders & Traps
Sunday: Rest
Advantages Of Body Part Workout Split:
Good for hypertrophy: Prioritizes isolation exercises focusing on singular muscle groups, allowing you to train it through a lot of volume in a single session.
You can choose the specific muscle group you want to grow: e.g. if growing your glutes is a priority, you can program to train them twice (as above), or even three times a week.
Adequate recovery time: You can train every day without the risk of overtraining because the same muscle groups aren’t trained on consecutive days.
Disadvantages Of Body Part Workout Split:
Risk of overtraining a muscle group: A whole session dedicated to two muscle groups is still quite a high volume, particularly for the smaller muscles such as the arm muscles.
Prioritizes isolation movements over compound exercises: May neglect multi-joint movements that translate directly to everyday life in favor of working a single muscle group at a time.
Little room for flexibility: If you miss a day, you risk throwing out your training balance for the week.
How To Decide What Is The Most Effective Workout Split
How long have you been training for?
If you’re new to picking up weights, start with a full body workout split. If you’ve been lifting for a while but want to boost your progress, you might look to a more advanced lift

What’s your goal?
Each workout split has its benefits that will help you reach your goals that little bit quicker.

Looking to grow your glutes or build bigger biceps? The body part split may be for you.
Want to test your limits on your 1 rep max deadlift? Try the upper-lower workout split.
Looking to build overall strength and muscle in a limited time? Give the full-body workout split a go.
How much time do you have?
Some workout splits are suited to training once or twice a week (full body split), whilst others require a higher level of time availability (body part workout split).

What do you enjoy?
Ultimately, the workout split you are most likely to stick to is going to be one that you enjoy. Choose one that most closely aligns with how you like to train – that way, it’s less likely to fall through, and you’re more likely to see results.

There’s no best or worst when it comes to workout splits. Ultimately, the style of training you decide to follow is dependent on you and your lifestyle.

Best Science-Based Workout Split to Maximize Muscle Gains
Training
Nov 7
One of the biggest decisions you have to make when you start hitting the gym is choosing which workout split to do. Or to put it simply, what exercises to do on different workout days of the week. For example, when I first started to gym, I used what was very popular in fitness magazines, and what my friends recommend - the “Bro Split”, meaning to do each muscle group once a week (Monday is International Chest Day!). I definitely build a significant amount of muscle over years of training, but the more important question is whether I would have progressed faster if I had used a better workout split. 

After years of lifting and research, I would say that there’s a high chance that using a different workout split would have accelerated my muscle growth. Finding a workout split is also a useful way to formulate a training plan and stick to it - an essential step to optimizing results. You wouldn’t want to walk into a gym finding the first empty machine and start pumping out reps would you? 

In this article, we will take a look at the different options and which one is best suited for you. Let’s dive in.

Workout splits have many advantages. But how do you choose the right one?
Workout splits have many advantages. But how do you choose the right one?

Different Workout Splits
Devising the most suitable training split for you revolves around many factors specific to you. This mainly includes 5 things: your training experience, goals, availability, rest and recovery needs and weakness. 

Beginners require less volume and intensity than advanced lifters. 

If your goal is to gain muscle, it will take more volume compared to someone who just want to maintain his/her shape. 

If you cannot commit to training 5 days a week, then it would be a smarter choice to choose a 3 or 4 day workout split.

Growth takes place outside the gym when you are resting and recovering. Generally, the splits are programmed for maximum recovery between each training day. But if you’re constantly sore from the previous workout, or feeling burnt out, it is best to cut back on training.

If you have a specific body part that you want to grow, adding another training session which focuses on that might be useful. 

All in all, I would say that the best training split is actually the one that you can stick to, and that is how many times you can commit to training each week. Training more usually gives more gains, but if you can’t commit to it, then it is unrealistic. 

Nevertheless, here are some of the most common workout splits to start from, beginning with the easiest and then progressing to the more advanced. This is because as you gain experience and become more advanced, you will need more volume to gain more mass. 

The best split is the one you can stick to!
The best split is the one you can stick to! 

Full Body Split (1, 2 or 3 Days / Week)
Monday: Full Body

Tuesday: Rest

Wednesday: Full Body

Thursday: Rest

Friday: Full Body

Saturday: Rest

Sunday: Rest

If you are serious about building muscle, training once or even twice a week may not be ideal. However, it is still better than not training at all. Nevertheless, you will need to increase your training frequency at some point.

A full body split is particularly good for beginners as it allows for at least 48 hours of rest in between workouts. This is important as beginners tend to experience high muscle soreness which can affect the next day’s workout. Focus on compound lifts like bench, deadlift and squat to hit more muscle groups simultaneously. This means ditching your bicep curls and triceps pulldowns. 

A full body split also allows beginners to hit the same muscle group three times a week, which is useful at the beginning phase of training where your nervous system needs to learn how to activate and utilize muscle fibres more efficiently. 

Upper-Lower Split (4 Days / Week)
Monday: Upper

Tuesday: Lower

Wednesday: Rest

Thursday: Upper

Friday: Lower

Saturday: Rest

Sunday: Rest

The next step to increase volume would be to cover the whole body over two days. This is done through an upper-lower split, where the upper consists of chest, back, shoulders and arms, while the lower consists of quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves and maybe abs.

With this increased volume, you can hit the same muscle group using different exercises and rep ranges, which can help target the different type of muscle fibres for even faster growth. Training on more days also means less time in the gym!

Sufficient rest is key to why you should use workout splits.
Sufficient rest is key to why you should use workout splits.

Push-Pull-Legs Split (5 or 6 Days / Week)
Monday: Push

Tuesday: Pull

Wednesday: Legs

Thursday: Rest

Friday: Push

Saturday: Pull

Sunday: Legs

As you progress even further, training the entire body over 3 days will allow you to do even more volume. This is done by grouping each workout day with push, pull and leg muscles. Push muscles are Chest, Triceps and Shoulders. Pull muscles are Back, Biceps, Rear Delts and Forearm. Leg muscles include Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves and Abductors. 

As you hit more volume, it is important to manage recovery effectively too. Training the same muscle group 3 days in a row can create excessive fatigue. The advantage of this split is so that your push muscles can rest on pull and legs day, your pull muscles can rest on push and legs day, and your leg muscles can rest on pull and push days. This allows for maximum recovery to perform optimally. 

Again, with more volume, you can target each muscle group with different exercises from different angles, together with multiple rep ranges.

Bro-Split (6 Days / Week)
Monday: Chest

Tuesday: Back

Wednesday: Shoulders

Thursday: Legs

Friday: Arms

Saturday: Legs

Sunday: Rest

Training 6 days a week can be too much volume due to diminishing recovery. The bro-split allocates each body part to each training day, allowing you to have high volume and intensity without worrying about insufficient recovery. 

However, the bro-split is unlikely the most optimal way to train for beginners or intermediates as it only targets each muscle group 1x per week. In this meta-analysis, when volume is matched, training each muscle group 2x per week has shown to elicit greater muscle growth than training each muscle group 1x per week. In another meta-analysis, participants who trained at a higher frequency had a 38% faster than those who trained at a lower frequency. This is because of a few reasons:

1) Better protein synthesis response throughout the week

2) Higher quality sets. If you have done 4 chest exercises in a row, you would know that your performance on the last exercise would be sub-optimal, but if you were to split the 4 chest exercises into two days, you will be able to better complete the exercise.

From the studies and reasons above, you can see why the Bro-Split might not be the best option for you if you would like to maximize muscle gains. Any other split is better as it targets each muscle group at least 2x per week.  

The bro-split which includes “Arms Day” may not be a good option for maximum muscle growth.
The bro-split which includes “Arms Day” may not be a good option for maximum muscle growth.

Recommendation
If you are a beginner, I would recommend the 3 day Full Body Split. In this split, you will be able to incorporate compound lifts which allow you to put on mass very quickly. Compound lifts also help to build up a good base of strength and endurance. But they also cause high fatigue as they target most muscle groups at a time. However, as you are only training 3x a week, you will be able to rest on the other 4 days of the week. 

A 3 day Split is also better as seen in this study where participants who split their workout into 3 days compared to 1 day per week felt their workouts were easier and recovered faster although they performed the same volume of work. This is especially important for a beginner as beginners are more prone to muscle damage and fatigue, which will greatly affect subsequent workouts. 

As you progress and gain more experience, you will inevitably need to increase volume to sufficiently challenge your muscles. This is the principle of progressive overload. You can increase the duration of your workout but there will be a limit by which you can increase the volume for each day. Working out for more than 1.5 hours may be too long for maximum growth. Thus, once you see your progress plateauing for a long time, you should consider training 4x a week using the Upper-Lower body split. 

And if you gain even more experience and are able to commit time to training, you should consider increasing your training to 5x or 6x a week, with Push-Pull-Legs split for example. It may actually be more enjoyable and less painful as the workout duration is shorter.

However, it is important to balance between progress and fatigue. Although there is a linear relationship between volume and muscle gains, it is only true to a certain point before it starts to plateau and can even decline. As seen in my previous article, there are many studies that show how multiple sets are superior for hypertrophy. However, you may pass a certain point where you’ll start to get diminishing returns for training, and may eventually reach a stage of overtraining. Overtraining is when the additional increase in volume gives a negative effect as it affects the recuperative ability. Thus, it is important that mindlessly increasing the weights is neither time-efficient nor advisable. 

In my previous article, I mentioned the upper limit of volume before overtraining occurs is 20 sets per muscle group per week.
In my previous article, I mentioned the upper limit of volume before overtraining occurs is 20 sets per muscle group per week.

Conclusion
So which split is the best for you? For beginners, it might be useful to start with a 3 day split, and slowly increasing your volume with a 4 or 5 day split as you gain more experience. But if you’re going to be constantly skipping workouts, you might want to adjust your training splits accordingly. Be realistic about how much time you can commit to training, then stick to your routine religiously. 

We can see that some splits have advantages over others. Each split has its pros and cons. There is no one-size-fit-all routine. You should look at the different factors involved, and use the splits as a tool to organize your volume in the most practical and enjoyable manner. 

Focus on consistency and you will see positive results!

In a Nutshell: Your Best Split = Your Best Gains
You need a training split that fits your goals, schedule, and recovery. Whether it's Bro Split, PPL, Upper/Lower, or Full Body, the key is consistency and hitting each muscle group 2-3 times per week for maximum growth.

Your workouts should balance volume, intensity, and recovery. Too much training? Burnout. Too little? No progress. Stick to compound movements for overall strength and isolation exercises to fine-tune weak points.

You’ll make the best gains with a split you can actually follow. Adjust when needed, keep it simple, and listen to your body. Consistency beats everything—stay at it, and the gains will come!

Best Workout Splits for Muscle Growth
Example of a popular strength training routine
When it comes to building muscle, the way you structure your workouts matters. A training split is simply how you divide your workout sessions over the week. Picking the right split can help you maximize your gains, keep your workouts fresh, and fit your schedule. There are several popular muscle growth splits, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Understanding these splits will help you make an informed decision about which one aligns with your goals. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, knowing how to organize your training can lead to better results.

Understanding the Bro Split
The Bro Split is one of the most well-known training splits. This method typically involves training one muscle group per day. For example, Monday is for chest, Tuesday for back, and so on. While this approach can be appealing, it has its drawbacks.

One major issue with the Bro Split is the volume. You might start strong but find that your energy wanes as the session progresses. By the end of your workout, you may be going through the motions rather than pushing yourself effectively. This can lead to suboptimal results.

Evaluating the Full Body Split
The Full Body Split is another popular choice. In this approach, you train all major muscle groups in each session, usually three to four times a week. This method can be effective, especially for busy individuals who want to maximize their workout time.

One of the main benefits of the Full Body Split is its versatility. You can adjust the volume and intensity based on your schedule and energy levels. However, the downside is that it may not allow for sufficient focus on specific muscle groups, making it harder to prioritize areas you want to improve.

The Push/Pull/Legs Split Explained
The Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) split is a great option for many lifters. It divides workouts into three categories: pushing movements, pulling movements, and leg exercises. This structure not only allows you to train each muscle group more frequently but also helps to manage fatigue effectively.

One of the standout features of the PPL split is its flexibility. You can easily adjust the order of workouts based on your recovery and schedule. This adaptability makes it an excellent choice for those who want to maintain consistency in their training.

Benefits of the Upper/Lower Split
The Upper/Lower Split is another effective method. It typically involves training upper body muscles one day and lower body muscles the next, allowing for ample recovery time. This split is great for those who can commit to training four days a week.

With an Upper/Lower Split, you can focus on compound movements while still having room for isolation exercises. This balance helps to build overall strength while targeting specific muscle groups. However, it may require more planning to ensure all areas are effectively trained.

Analyzing Popular Strength Programs
Many lifters turn to popular strength programs like Starting Strength or 5/3/1. While these programs emphasize compound lifts and can lead to significant strength gains, they may not always be optimal for muscle growth.

These routines often focus on fewer exercises and lower volume, which can leave gaps in muscle development. If your goal is to maximize muscle hypertrophy, incorporating a variety of exercises and higher volume is essential.

Key Principles for Designing Effective Splits
When designing a training split, focus on a few key principles. These principles ensure that your workouts are effective and that you can recover properly. The first principle is recovery time. Make sure your muscles have enough time to recover between sessions. If you train a muscle group too frequently, you risk overtraining.

The second principle is avoiding excessive downtime. If a muscle group is fully recovered but you wait too long to train it again, you may miss out on potential gains. Finding the sweet spot is crucial.

Lastly, consider interference effects. Training certain muscle groups on consecutive days can lead to fatigue that affects performance. For instance, doing heavy back exercises may hinder your leg day if they follow closely. Balance your schedule to optimize your performance.

Common Mistakes in Training Splits
Many lifters make mistakes when choosing or following a training split. One common mistake is not adjusting the split according to personal recovery needs. Everyone’s recovery ability differs, and sticking rigidly to a predetermined schedule can hinder progress.

Another mistake is choosing a split that doesn’t align with your goals. For instance, if you're focused on hypertrophy but follow a strength-oriented program, you may not achieve the desired results.

Additionally, overcomplicating the split can lead to confusion. Simplicity often yields better results. Stick to a structure that allows you to focus on your lifts and progress without unnecessary complexity.

Adjusting Frequency for Optimal Recovery
Finding the right training frequency is essential for muscle growth. A common approach is training major muscle groups two to three times a week. This frequency allows for adequate recovery while maximizing muscle stimulation.

However, individual factors such as training intensity and volume should dictate how often you train each muscle group. If you feel fatigued or sore, it might be beneficial to reduce the frequency temporarily.

Listening to your body is key. If you find that you’re consistently sore or not recovering well, consider adjusting your split. You may need to incorporate more rest days or reduce the number of sets per session.

The Role of Exercise Selection in Splits
Exercise selection plays a significant role in the effectiveness of any training split. Compound movements should form the foundation of your workouts. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups and allow for greater overall strength gains.

However, isolation exercises are also crucial. They help target specific muscles that may need extra attention. For example, if your biceps are lagging, adding additional curls can help improve their development.

Balance is vital. Ensure your split includes a mix of both compound and isolation exercises to achieve well-rounded development. This approach not only maximizes muscle growth but also helps prevent imbalances.

Flexibility in Training Schedules
Illustration of a flexible training schedule
Flexibility in your training schedule is essential for long-term success. Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes you may need to adjust your training days. Having a flexible split allows you to adapt without losing momentum.

For instance, if you miss a workout, you can easily shift your schedule rather than feel discouraged. You can also adjust the volume of your workouts based on how you feel each day. If you’re fatigued, consider lowering the intensity or volume for that session.

Remember, consistency is key, but it shouldn't come at the expense of your well-being. A flexible approach can help you maintain your training habit over time.

Volume Considerations in Different Splits
Volume is a critical factor in training splits. It refers to the total amount of work done, typically measured in sets and reps. Different splits require different volume strategies to be effective.

For example, a Bro Split often involves high volume for each muscle group once a week. In contrast, a Push/Pull/Legs split may allow for lower volume per session but higher overall weekly volume due to increased frequency.

Understanding how to manipulate volume is vital for maximizing gains. If you notice stagnation, consider adjusting the number of sets or reps, or even the type of exercises you perform. This can provide the stimulus needed for continued progress.

Expert Opinions on Training Splits
Full body split workout example
Experts often debate the effectiveness of various training splits. Many agree that the best split largely depends on individual goals and circumstances. Some prefer higher frequency, while others focus on volume and intensity.

For instance, many bodybuilders advocate for splits that allow for muscle recovery while maximizing tension. They often argue that training a muscle group two to three times a week can enhance growth. This frequency allows you to stimulate muscle fibers more effectively while giving them adequate recovery time.

Conversely, some strength coaches emphasize the importance of compound lifts and suggest that a lower frequency can still yield results. They believe that as long as the lifts are performed with high intensity, muscle growth can still occur.

Ultimately, it’s crucial to listen to your body and adjust your training split based on how you feel and your progress.

Temporary Solutions: Using Full Body Splits
Sometimes, life gets busy. You might not have the luxury of a consistent training schedule. In such cases, a full body split can be a temporary solution. This approach allows you to hit all major muscle groups in a single session, typically three to four times a week.

The beauty of a full body split is its flexibility. It can fit into a hectic lifestyle, allowing for workouts that don't demand a lot of time. You can easily squeeze in a session when you have a spare hour or two. This makes it ideal for those who travel or have unpredictable schedules.

However, while full body splits can maintain your muscle mass, they may not be optimal for long-term growth. The lack of specialization can lead to insufficient volume for specific muscle groups. If your goal is to build muscle, consider this approach a stopgap rather than a permanent solution.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Choosing the right training split is essential for achieving your muscle growth goals. Each split has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on your lifestyle, training experience, and specific goals.

If you're just starting, consider a full body or upper/lower split. These options provide a solid foundation for building muscle and improving strength. As you progress, you might experiment with more specialized splits, like Push/Pull/Legs or a Bro split, to fine-tune your training.

Remember, consistency is key. Stick to a split that you can maintain over the long term. Monitor your progress and be willing to adjust your approach as needed. The most effective split is one that fits your individual needs and allows you to train regularly without burnout.

Expert Corner: Proven Strategies & Hidden Gems
Practical Applications
Train muscles 2-3 times per week – Instead of hitting chest once a week with a Bro Split, try Upper/Lower or Push/Pull/Legs to train each muscle group twice. More frequency = more growth!
Balance volume & intensity – Doing 20+ sets per workout? You might be overdoing it. Stick to 10-15 quality sets per muscle group per week for steady progress.
Use compound + isolation exercises – Start your workouts with heavy squats, deadlifts, and presses for strength, then finish with isolation moves like curls or lateral raises for detail work.
Listen to your recovery needs – If you’re sore for days after a workout, you might need more rest or lower volume. If you’re not sore at all, you might need to increase intensity.
Stay flexible with your split – Life happens! If you miss a day, shift your workouts instead of skipping them entirely. A good split adapts to your schedule, not the other way around.
Examples

Busy schedule? Do a Full Body split 3x per week instead of struggling to hit 5-6 workouts.
Lagging muscle group? Add an extra session with focused isolation exercises (e.g., extra arm day if biceps are behind).
Fact-Check of Key Points
“Training a muscle group 2-3 times per week is best for growth.” While this is a solid guideline, it’s not a hard rule. Some lifters see great results training once a week (especially with high volume), while others thrive on higher frequency. Your recovery and intensity matter just as much.
“Low-frequency strength programs like 5/3/1 aren’t optimal for muscle growth.” This depends on how you define ‘optimal’. While these programs focus on strength over size, they still build muscle if paired with enough volume. Many lifters see solid hypertrophy gains by simply adding more accessory work.
“Bro Splits aren’t efficient for hypertrophy.” True in many cases, but not always. Plenty of bodybuilders use and swear by Bro Splits. If you train with enough intensity, volume, and progression, a Bro Split can still build serious muscle—it’s just not the most time-efficient approach.
“Compound lifts should be the foundation of every split.” Generally true, but not universal. If your goal is pure hypertrophy, you might benefit from more machine and isolation work to minimize joint strain and maximize muscle activation.
“Overcomplicating your split leads to poor results.” Mostly true—simplicity works. But some complexity can be useful for advanced lifters who need specialized programming to fix weaknesses or push past plateaus.
Bottom line? No one-size-fits-all approach exists. The best training split depends on your body, goals, and recovery ability.

More Little-Known Tips for the Best Workout Splits for Muscle Growth
Train Weak Points First – If your arms or legs are lagging, don’t save them for the end. Hit them first when your energy is highest to get the best results.
Use Auto-Regulation – Feeling beat up? Drop the volume or intensity that day. Feeling strong? Push harder! Adjusting based on how you feel keeps progress steady.
Rotate Rep Ranges – Sticking to one rep range = stalled growth. Mix in heavy (4-6 reps), moderate (8-12 reps), and high-rep (15-20 reps) sets to target all muscle fibers.
Strategic Rest Days – Don’t just take a rest day when you're sore. Plan them around big lifts (like squats or deadlifts) to hit them fresh and lift them heavier.
Experiment with Split Timing – If you’re short on time, try a two-a-day split (e.g., push in the morning, pull at night). It’s intense but splits up fatigue and boosts recovery.

Science of Muscle Growth Training Splits
Muscle hypertrophy and strength development are key goals in resistance training, and various training splits are employed to optimize these outcomes. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared split routines (training different muscle groups on separate days) versus full-body routines, finding no significant difference in strength gains or muscle hypertrophy when training volume is equated (Ramos-Campo et al., 2024).

Key Findings from Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
Training Volume is the Key Factor – When total weekly volume is controlled, split and full-body routines yield similar hypertrophy and strength gains (Ramos-Campo et al., 2024).
Load Matters for Strength, Not Hypertrophy – High-load resistance training is superior for strength development, but muscle hypertrophy can occur across a range of training loads as long as volume is matched (Carvalho et al., 2022).
Excessive Training Volume Can Be Counterproductive – A meta-analysis found that too many sets per workout can negatively impact muscle growth, suggesting that optimal volume distribution is crucial (Benito et al., 2020).
Practical Applications of Science
Choose a Training Split That Fits Your Schedule – Since both full-body and split routines yield similar results, individual preference and recovery should guide selection.
Focus on Total Weekly Volume – Ensure sufficient volume per muscle group each week, rather than fixating on split type.
Avoid Excessive Training Per Session – Overloading with too many sets in a single workout may hinder growth; balance intensity and recovery.
Scientific Conclusion
Resistance training splits do not inherently influence hypertrophy or strength gains when training volume is controlled. The most important factors for muscle growth and strength are total weekly volume, load intensity, and proper recovery strategies.

My Opinion on the Best Workout Splits for Muscle Growth
I think the best workout splits for muscle growth are the ones that fit your schedule, recovery, and intensity—not just what some fitness guru says works best. I see too many people forcing themselves into trendy splits like push/pull/legs, even when they’re constantly sore and fatigued. If you’re dragging yourself through workouts, are you growing?

Many people swear by bro splits, but I don’t think they’re as bad as they’re made out to be. Sure, science says training a muscle twice a week is “optimal,” but let’s be real—tons of bodybuilders have built insane physiques hitting each muscle once a week. If you train with severe intensity, once is enough. I’d rather see someone crush chest on Monday and take the rest of the week to recover properly than half-ass it every other day.

I also think most people overcomplicate their splits. You don’t need fancy periodization or a perfect mix of volume and frequency. The truth? Just pick a split you enjoy, push hard, and stay consistent. Whether that’s a full body, upper/lower, or something custom, it's the best split if it works for you.

Wrapping Up the Best Workout Splits for Muscle Growth
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to the best workout splits for muscle growth. Some lifters thrive on a higher frequency, while others make gains by training each muscle once a week. The key is finding what works for your body, lifestyle, and recovery while staying consistent and pushing yourself in every session.

But let’s be real—tracking volume, adjusting splits, and ensuring you’re progressing can get complicated. That’s why the Dr. Muscle app is a game-changer. It automates your programming, adapts to your progress, and optimizes your workouts, so you don’t have to overthink it. Just follow the plan and let smart training do the work.

FAQ
What is the best workout split for muscle growth?
The best workout split for muscle growth depends on training frequency, recovery, and intensity. Popular options include Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, Full Body, and Bro Splits, each with its pros and cons. The key is choosing a split that allows consistent progression and suits individual recovery needs.

How often should I train each muscle group for optimal gains?
Training each muscle group 2-3 times per week is generally recommended for muscle growth and recovery balance. Higher frequency training allows for more muscle stimulation over time, while lower frequency requires higher volume per session. The right approach depends on individual recovery ability and training intensity.

Is a Push/Pull/Legs split more effective than a Bro Split?
A Push/Pull/Legs split is often considered more efficient than a Bro Split because it allows each muscle group to be trained twice per week instead of once. However, a Bro Split can still be effective if training intensity and volume are high enough. The best choice depends on individual goals, recovery, and training consistency.

Can beginners benefit from split routines, or should they stick to full-body workouts?
Beginners can benefit from Full Body workouts because they allow for higher frequency per muscle group and better movement learning. Split routines can work for beginners if training volume is managed properly, but Full Body splits are often more effective for early strength and muscle gains.

How do I choose the right workout split based on my fitness goals?
Choosing the right workout split depends on training experience, recovery capacity, and goals. Full Body or Upper/Lower splits work well for strength and general fitness, while Push/Pull/Legs or Bro Splits may be better for advanced hypertrophy training. The best split is one that allows consistent progress and fits personal recovery ability.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of different workout splits?
Workout splits vary in frequency, intensity, and recovery demands. Push/Pull/Legs balances frequency and recovery well, while Bro Splits allow high-volume focus on individual muscle groups but with lower frequency. Full Body training is efficient for beginners, but may limit muscle-specific focus compared to more specialized splits.

How can I adjust my workout split to fit my schedule?
Adjusting a workout split involves modifying training days, volume, or exercise selection to match personal availability. A Full Body split can work for those with only 3 days per week, while Upper/Lower or PPL can be adapted for 4-6 days. Consistency and proper recovery management are key to long-term progress.

What if I miss a workout?
Missing a workout is not a major setback if training remains consistent overall. The easiest solution is to shift the missed session to the next available day or continue with the schedule as planned without trying to compensate excessively. Flexibility in training helps maintain long-term adherence and progress.

How do I know if my split is working?
A workout split is working if strength, muscle size, or endurance improves over time. Signs of an effective split include steady progress in lifts, muscle fullness, and good recovery between sessions. If stagnation, excessive soreness, or lack of progress occurs, adjustments in frequency, volume, or intensity may be needed.

What constitutes the best workout routine for men depends on the person. Bodybuilders want targeted shoulder workouts for cannonball delts, quad workouts to make their VMO pop, and back workouts for a V taper. Hybrid athletes (think Hyrox) want sessions that blend functional training with cardio. And endurance athletes want to learn how to increase VO2 max with steady-state (think Zone 2 training) and HIIT workouts.  

And while there’s no one best workout program for men, one modality promises to get your heart rate up, burn calories, and strengthen muscles simultaneously: circuit training.

With circuit training, you use heavy but manageable loads and work multiple muscle groups in the same routine by rotating through compound exercises with little rest between sets. This can prompt the optimal metabolic response known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC).

We like to call that the “afterburn” effect in which your body continues to burn calories for up to 48 hours post-workout. This offers you the biggest bang for your effort and time. As far as good workout plans go, we’d argue that’s chief among them, don’t you?

What Is Circuit Training?
Circuit training is pretty much exactly as it sounds. It involves performing around 8 to 10 exercises one after another with little to no rest. Often confused with its high-intensity counterpart, HIIT, circuit training allows you to whip through a workout without wasting any time. While circuit style training isn’t for everyone, this well-liked style of training has an array of benefits including increased muscular endurance, improved cardiorespiratory health, weight loss, and more. 

How Long Does It Take to Get in Shape With Good Workout Plans?
The amount of time it takes to lose weight varies from person to person and comes down to how often they train, how they train, their nutrition, and their starting point, according to Jahkeen Washington, a certified personal trainer and owner of Harlem Kettlebell Club.

“I think that a three-month commitment to exercise two to three times a week is plenty, and that’s where I’ve seen most people really start to buy in and see the results they’re looking for,” says Washington. “For the first month, you tend to learn the how, the what, the why—what exercises work and what doesn’t. Then by months two and three, you’re able to really start to adjust and hit things pretty hard. By then, someone has 30 days in, they’ve got some consistency, and some of that early soreness they experience is starting to fade away.”

How to Make a Workout Routine and Training Plan that Delivers Big Results
Trying to create a workout plan for strength, muscle mass, or weight loss? Use these 7 trainer-backed guidelines to build a routine that will deliver results.

How Often Should I Do the Best Workout Program for Men?
A workout routine isn’t as easy as a simple math equation. According to Washington while three days might be the key to fat loss and muscle gain for some, others might have to squeeze a few more workouts in to see the results they want.

“In a perfect world, someone can train five days a week,” says Washington. “In terms of weight loss, I think it depends on the person and how much weight they’re trying to lose.” 

Someone trying to shave off five pounds won’t need to be as aggressive. [They] won’t need to work as hard or as frequently as someone who has a lot more to lose or is looking to set a goal and have a timeframe on it. The amount of weight someone wants to lose (and how quickly) will dictate how many times per week they need to work out.

Check out the best science-based workout split to maximise muscle growth.

When you first join a gym you have a big decision to make even before you begin working out at a machine or picking up the barbell. Which workout split will you do? Jeremy Ethier gave his opinion on the matter.

Jeremy Ethier is a kinesiologist and fitness trainer, co-founder of Built With Science. His YouTube channel has over 4 million subscribers and he delivers clear information with sound background research.

In one of his videos, he shared what he believes to be the best science-based workout split to maximise muscle growth. There are 4 popular options for you to choose from:

Bro split
Upper / lower body
Push / pull / legs
Full body
Best Science-Based Workout Split To Maximise Muscle Growth
So which one is the best according to science?

First of all, the bro split training program is probably the least effective. According to Ethier, studies have shown that when the volume is matched, training each muscle twice per week results in significantly greater muscle growth than training each muscle just once a week, which is what the bro split usually recommends.

With bro split out of the question, what is the best science-based workout split to maximise muscle growth? It depends, mainly, on your training experience.

Best Science-Based
For beginners looking to put on mass, a 3-day workout split with full-body workouts will likely give you great results faster.

As you gain more experience, you need to progressively overload and, therefore, change your training routine. In this case, changing to an upper/lower body split program can be beneficial if you begin working out 4 days per week.

Lastly, to gain even more mass, you need to put in the extra work and hit the gym 5 or perhaps 6 times a week. In this case, the push/pull/legs split program would be a good choice to keep your workouts from being excessively long and fatiguing.
