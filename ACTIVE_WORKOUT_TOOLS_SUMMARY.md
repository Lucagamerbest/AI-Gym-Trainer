Enhanced the existing `logWorkoutSet` tool with 3 new optional parameters to capture richer workout data during active training sessions.

**New Parameters:**
1. **`rpe`** (number, 1-10) - Rate of Perceived Exertion
   - 10 = absolute failure
   - 9 = 1 rep left in tank
   - 8 = 2 reps left
   - 7 = 3 reps left, etc.

2. **`setType`** (enum) - Type of set performed
   - `'normal'` - Standard working set (default)
   - `'warmup'` - Warmup set
   - `'dropset'` - Dropset
   - `'failure'` - Set taken to failure
   - `'superset'` - Superset exercise

3. **`notes`** (string) - Optional notes about the set
   - Examples: "felt easy", "struggled on last rep", "using different grip"

### **Location:**
- **Implementation:** `src/services/ai/tools/CRUDTools.js` (lines 70-176)
- **Schema:** `src/services/ai/tools/CRUDTools.js` (lines 536-578)
- **Registration:** `src/services/ai/tools/index.js` (line 95)

### **What Users Can Now Say:**

**With RPE:**
- "Log 225 for 8 reps at RPE 8"
- "I just did 315 for 5 at RPE 9"

**With Set Type:**
- "135 for 10 reps warmup"
- "That was 315 for 5 to failure"
- "Log 225 for 8 reps dropset"

**With Notes:**
- "Log 225 for 8 reps, felt really easy today"
- "315 for 5, struggled on the last rep"

**Full Featured:**
- "315 for 5 reps at RPE 10 to failure, spotter helped on last rep"

### **Success Messages:**

```
Without extras: "Logged set 1: 225 lbs √ó 8 reps on Bench Press"
With RPE:       "Logged set 1: 225 lbs √ó 8 reps @ RPE 8 on Bench Press"
With setType:   "Logged set 1: 135 lbs √ó 10 reps (warmup) on Bench Press"
Combined:       "Logged set 1: 315 lbs √ó 5 reps @ RPE 10 (failure) on Bench Press"
```
