# Workout AI Assistant Implementation

## Overview
The "Ask AI Assistant" button at the bottom of the WorkoutScreen now opens a **real AI chat interface** with quick-action buttons specifically designed for active workout control.

## What Changed

### 1. **New AI Section Configuration** (`src/config/aiSectionConfig.js`)

Added `WorkoutAssistantSections` - a dedicated AI section config for the workout assistant with 3 categories:

#### **Log Sets** (Quick commands for logging)
- "Type command..." - Custom input for any command
- "Log current set" - Quick log without details
- "Log set with RPE" - Log with difficulty rating
- "Log warmup set" - Log warmup sets

#### **Workout Control** (Manage your workout)
- "Skip to next exercise" - Jump to next exercise
- "Remove exercise" - Remove from current workout
- "Reorder exercises" - Change exercise order
- "Start rest timer" - Begin countdown timer

#### **Status & Finish** (Check progress and complete)
- "Check my progress" - See sets, volume, duration
- "Finish workout" - Complete and save workout
- "Finish with rating" - Complete with 1-5 star rating

---

### 2. **WorkoutScreen Updates** (`src/screens/WorkoutScreen.js`)

**Added Import:**
```javascript
import AIButtonModal from '../components/AIButtonModal';
```

**Replaced Placeholder Modal** (Lines 1585-1590):
```javascript
{/* AI Workout Assistant Modal */}
<AIButtonModal
  visible={showAIAssistant}
  onClose={() => setShowAIAssistant(false)}
  screenName="WorkoutAssistant"
/>
```

**Removed:**
- 29 lines of placeholder modal code
- "AI is currently being built" message
- Static info text
