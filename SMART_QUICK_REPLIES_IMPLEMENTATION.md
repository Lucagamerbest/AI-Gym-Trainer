# Smart Quick Replies for Workout Logging

## Overview
Implemented an intelligent quick-reply system that shows **contextual options** based on what the AI is asking, making workout logging fast and intuitive.

---

## How It Works

### **Flow:**

1. **User taps**: "Log current set" button
2. **AI asks**: "What exercise, weight, and reps should I log?"
3. **Quick replies show**: List of exercises from your active workout (e.g., "🏋️ Bench Press", "🏋️ Bicep Curl")
4. **User taps**: "🏋️ Bench Press"
5. **Input form appears**: Two fields for Weight (lbs) and Reps with a checkmark button
6. **User enters**: 225 (weight) and 8 (reps)
7. **User taps**: Checkmark button
8. **AI logs**: "Log 225 pounds for 8 reps on Bench Press"
9. **Set is logged**: Success message appears

---

## Implementation Details

### **1. Detection System**

Added `detectExerciseLogQuestion()` function that recognizes when AI asks about logging:

```javascript
const detectExerciseLogQuestion = (response) => {
  const exerciseLogKeywords = [
    'what exercise',
    'which exercise',
    'exercise.*log',
    'exercise.*weight.*reps',
    'log.*exercise',
  ];
  // Returns true if AI is asking which exercise to log
};
```

### **2. State Management**

Added new state variables:

```javascript
const [selectedExercise, setSelectedExercise] = useState(null);
const [weightInput, setWeightInput] = useState('');
const [repsInput, setRepsInput] = useState('');
const [activeWorkoutExercises, setActiveWorkoutExercises] = useState([]);
```

### **3. Load Active Workout Exercises**

When the modal opens (WorkoutAssistant screen only), it loads exercises from AsyncStorage:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (visible && screenName === 'WorkoutAssistant') {
    const activeWorkout = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@active_workout');
    const exercises = activeWorkout.exercises.map(ex => ex.name);
    setActiveWorkoutExercises(exercises); // ['Bench Press', 'Bicep Curl', ...]
  }
}, [visible, screenName]);
```

### **4. Exercise Selection Quick Replies**

When AI asks "What exercise...", show exercise buttons:

```javascript
{isExerciseLogQuestion ? (
  <>
    {/* Exercise Selection Buttons */}
    {activeWorkoutExercises.map((exerciseName, index) => (
      <TouchableOpacity
        key={index}
        style={[styles.quickReplyButton, styles.exerciseButton]}
        onPress={() => handleExerciseSelection(exerciseName)}
      >
        <Text>🏋️ {exerciseName}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    ))}
  </>
) : ...}
```

### **5. Weight/Reps Input Form**

After selecting an exercise, show input form:

```javascript
{selectedExercise && (
  <View style={styles.weightRepsContainer}>
    <Text>🏋️ {selectedExercise}</Text>
    <View style={styles.weightRepsInputRow}>
      <TextInput // Weight input
        placeholder="225"
        keyboardType="numeric"
        value={weightInput}
        onChangeText={setWeightInput}
      />
      <TextInput // Reps input
        placeholder="8"
        keyboardType="numeric"
        value={repsInput}
        onChangeText={setRepsInput}
      />
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={handleLogSet}>
        <Ionicons name="checkmark" size={24} />
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  </View>
)}
```

### **6. Submit Handler**

When checkmark is pressed, build message and send to AI:

```javascript
const handleLogSet = async () => {
  const message = `Log ${weightInput} pounds for ${repsInput} reps on ${selectedExercise}`;

  // Send to AI with tools
  const result = await AIService.sendMessageWithTools(message, context);

  // Clear inputs
  setSelectedExercise(null);
  setWeightInput('');
  setRepsInput('');
};
```

## User Experience

### **Before (Generic Replies)**:
```
AI: "What exercise, weight, and reps should I log?"
Quick Replies: [ ✓ Yes ] [ ✕ No ] [ ? Not sure ]
❌ Not helpful!
```

### **After (Smart Replies)**:
```
AI: "What exercise, weight, and reps should I log?"
Quick Replies: [ 🏋️ Bench Press ] [ 🏋️ Bicep Curl ] [ 🏋️ Squat ]
User taps: Bench Press

[Weight/Reps Form Appears]
🏋️ Bench Press
Weight (lbs): [225]  Reps: [8]  [✓]

✅ Fast, intuitive, hands-free friendly!
```

## Benefits

### **For Users:**
✅ **No typing needed** - Tap exercise from list
✅ **Visual feedback** - See which exercise selected
✅ **Quick input** - Simple weight/reps fields
✅ **Error prevention** - Only show exercises actually in workout
✅ **Natural flow** - Follows conversation pattern

### **For Developers:**
✅ **Reusable pattern** - Can add more smart replies for other questions
✅ **Context-aware** - Adapts to current screen (WorkoutAssistant only)
✅ **State management** - Clean separation of concerns
✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add RPE, set type, notes, etc.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add RPE input** - Show RPE slider after weight/reps
2. **Add set type** - Quick buttons for "Warmup", "Dropset", "Failure"
3. **Add notes field** - Optional notes for the set
4. **Smart defaults** - Pre-fill with last set's weight/reps
5. **Voice input** - Enable voice for weight/reps (iOS dictation)
6. **Auto-increment** - Suggest weight based on previous sets
